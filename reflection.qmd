title: "Reflection on the Use of GenAI"

## GenAI Tool Used

For this assessment, I used **ChatGPT** as a Generative AI tool to support the development of my personal website using Quarto and GitHub Pages.

## How GenAI Helped Me

GenAI was particularly helpful in:
- Guiding me through the setup of R, RStudio, Quarto, and GitHub Pages  
- Explaining technical steps clearly when I encountered errors or confusion  
- Helping to structure and refine written content for the website pages  

For example, GenAI helped me transform rough notes into well-structured markdown sections suitable for a professional website.

## Benefits of Using GenAI

The main benefits of using GenAI include:
- Faster problem-solving when dealing with unfamiliar tools  
- Reduced time spent searching through documentation  
- Improved clarity and organisation in my writing  

This allowed me to focus more on understanding the concepts rather than struggling with formatting or syntax.

## Challenges and Limitations

One challenge was ensuring that I did not rely too heavily on the tool without understanding the underlying steps.  
I had to carefully verify instructions and make sure that the final content accurately reflected my own learning and experience.

## Future Use of GenAI

In the future, I see GenAI as a valuable support tool for both study and work, particularly for:
- Learning new technologies  
- Drafting reports and documentation  
- Troubleshooting technical issues  

However, I believe it should be used responsibly alongside critical thinking and independent problem-solving.
