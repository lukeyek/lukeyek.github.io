## Overview

The chart below shows the **daily performance of different marketing channels** across a week (Mon–Sun).  
Each horizontal bar represents one day, and the bar is divided into five channels: **Direct, Mail Ad, Affiliate Ad, Video Ad, and Search Engine**.

## What is visualised?

This is a **stacked horizontal bar chart** where the numeric labels on each segment represent the value contributed by each channel on that day.  
By stacking the channels, the chart also shows the **total daily volume** (overall bar length) while still allowing us to see how the total is made up.

## Key observations

- **Search Engine** contributes the **largest share** on every day, and it increases noticeably towards the weekend.
- The **overall total** is higher on **Saturday and Sunday**, suggesting stronger engagement or conversions on weekends.
- Channels like **Mail Ad** and **Affiliate Ad** contribute smaller portions, but their contribution remains fairly consistent across the week.

## Why I chose this chart type

I chose a stacked bar chart because it allows two comparisons at once:
1. **Across days:** which day has a higher total.
2. **Within a day:** how much each channel contributes to that day’s total.

Using a **horizontal layout** also improves readability of day labels and makes the segment values easier to scan.

## Story behind this task

This visualisation was created to communicate marketing performance clearly and quickly.  
Instead of listing numbers in a table, the chart makes it obvious which channel drives most results and which days tend to perform better, supporting better decisions on where to focus effort and budget.
