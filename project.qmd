## Project Overview

This page describes one of the key projects I have worked on as part of my studies, which focused on analysing data and communicating insights effectively through visualisation.

## Project Title

**Marketing Channel Performance Analysis**

## Background

The objective of this project was to analyse how different marketing channels performed across a week and to identify patterns in user engagement.\
Rather than relying on raw tables of numbers, the task emphasised the importance of using data visualisation to make comparisons clearer and insights more accessible to decision-makers.

## My Role

In this project, I was responsible for: - Preparing and organising the dataset for analysis\
- Designing an appropriate visualisation to represent multi-channel data\
- Interpreting the results and explaining the observed trends

The tools used included spreadsheet software and visualisation techniques commonly applied in data analytics.

## Key Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I developed: - A stronger understanding of how to visualise quantitative data effectively\
- The ability to select suitable chart types for comparative analysis\
- Improved data interpretation and communication skills

Overall, this project strengthened my appreciation of how clear visual design can significantly enhance data-driven decision-making.
